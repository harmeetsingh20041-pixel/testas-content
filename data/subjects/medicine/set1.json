        "text": "Working in health-care settings often means facing time pressure, high stakes, and emotionally charged encounters. When environmental demands feel severe enough to exceed an individual's resources, the result is psychological stress. Two main neuro-endocrine systems are activated: the sympatho-adreno-medullary (SAM) axis, releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline for an immediate \"fight-or-flight\" response, and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, culminating in cortisol secretion that sustains energy supply but, when chronic, impairs immunity and mood."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "According to Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model, an event causes stress only if it is appraised as threatening and coping resources are judged inadequate. Coping strategies can be broadly grouped into problem-focused approaches that change the stressor, emotion-focused approaches that regulate the emotional response, and maladaptive or avoidant strategies that provide short-term relief at the cost of long-term functioning."
